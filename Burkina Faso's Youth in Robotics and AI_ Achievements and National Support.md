# Burkina Faso's Youth in Robotics and AI: Achievements and National Support

The youth of Burkina Faso have recently made a significant impact on the international stage, particularly in the fields of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Their achievements in 2024 and 2025, coupled with the highly visible support from the head of state, Captain Ibrahim Traoré, highlight a growing national focus on technological innovation as a key driver for the country's future development.

## International Achievements in Robotics and AI (2024-2025)

Burkinabe youth teams have participated in major global competitions, demonstrating their technical aptitude and problem-solving skills. The most notable successes have occurred in 2025, with two major awards secured in international events.

### The 2025 FIRST Global Challenge

The **FIRST Global Challenge** is an annual Olympics-style international robotics competition that brings together youth from over 190 nations. In 2025, the competition was held in Panama City, Panama, from October 29 to November 1 [1].

The team from Burkina Faso, associated with the GobeLab engineers, achieved a significant victory by winning the **Gold Medal in the Judges Award** category [2]. This award is highly prestigious, recognizing the team whose unique efforts, performance, or dynamic best embodies the spirit of the *FIRST* Global Challenge, including teamwork, communication, and the ability to overcome adversity [3]. While some local media reports celebrated the team as "world champions," the official results clarify that the Gold Medal was for this specific, non-technical award, distinguishing it from the overall Albert Einstein Award or the Tournament Finals [2]. This achievement, nonetheless, is a powerful symbol of the team's spirit and contribution to the global robotics community.

### The 2025 Robotics for Good Youth Challenge

Further demonstrating their capabilities, a Burkinabe youth team also secured a medal in the **Robotics for Good Youth Challenge 2025**, a competition organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under its AI for Good initiative. The team earned a **Bronze Medal (Third Place)** in this competition, which focuses on designing robots for disaster response and humanitarian applications [4]. One of the team members, Hiram Amoussou, was specifically noted for his success in this event [5].

### Summary of Competition Performance

The table below summarizes the key participation and achievements of the Burkinabe youth teams in major international competitions over the last two years.

| Competition | Year | Location | Achievement | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FIRST Global Challenge** | 2025 | Panama City, Panama | **Gold Medal (Judges Award)** | Recognized for team spirit, collaboration, and unique contribution [2]. |
| **Robotics for Good Youth Challenge** | 2025 | Global (ITU AI for Good) | **Bronze Medal (Third Place)** | Focused on robotics for disaster response and humanitarian aid [4]. |
| **FIRST Global Challenge** | 2024 | Athens, Greece | Ranked #165 | A respectable performance among 191 participating nations [6]. |

## Captain Ibrahim Traoré's Support and the National Tech Agenda

The achievements of the youth teams have been strongly amplified by the political leadership, particularly Captain Ibrahim Traoré, who has actively positioned himself as a champion of technological self-reliance and innovation.

### Presidential Recognition and Encouragement

Captain Traoré personally received and congratulated the winners of the 2025 *FIRST* Global Challenge, using the occasion to reinforce the national importance of their success [7]. This high-profile reception serves to elevate the status of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) within the country and encourages other young people to pursue these fields.

### The "Digital Revolution" and National Initiatives

Under Captain Traoré's leadership, the government has launched an ambitious initiative often referred to as a "Digital Revolution" or "Coup in Technology," with a stated goal of integrating AI and robotics into the national development strategy [8]. Key aspects of this national tech agenda include:

*   **Educational Integration:** Reports indicate a push to integrate coding, robotics, electronics, and AI into the school curriculum, aiming to build a technologically proficient workforce from a young age [9].
*   **Talent Development:** The launch of the "Faso Andubè" digital platform is intended to discover and nurture hidden technological talents across the country [10].
*   **Practical Application:** The GobeLab engineers, who represented Burkina Faso, have been noted for designing robots with practical applications, such as those intended to help with biodiversity restoration and sanitation, directly aligning with national development goals [7].

### Broader Context of IT and AI in Burkina Faso

The focus on technology extends beyond competition. The country has hosted a "Digital Week," during which a locally-designed and programmed humanoid robot, the G1, was showcased [11]. Furthermore, programs like "ASI TALK" were launched in August 2025 to train hundreds of young people in digital innovation [12].

While the government's promotion of these achievements is robust, it is important to note that some claims, such as those regarding "100% made in Burkina Faso" robots, have been subject to scrutiny [13]. Nevertheless, the political will to support and celebrate these technological advancements is undeniable, positioning the country's youth at the forefront of a highly publicized national push for technological sovereignty.
